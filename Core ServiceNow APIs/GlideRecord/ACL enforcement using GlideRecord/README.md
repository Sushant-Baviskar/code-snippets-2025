GlideRecordSecure is a server-side API in ServiceNow that functions almost the same as GlideRecord, but with enhanced security checks.
It ensures that ACLs (Access Control Lists) are enforced when querying or manipulating data â€” unlike the regular GlideRecord, which can bypass certain security rules if used in scripts with elevated privileges (like Business Rules, Script Includes, or background scripts).
You should always use GlideRecordSecure when your script executes in a context that runs on behalf of the logged-in user, especially:

âœ… Recommended Use Cases

1.UI Actions (visible to users)
To ensure users only see records/fields they are authorized to.

2.UI Pages / UI Macros / Widgets
When fetching data dynamically for client-side rendering.

3.Scripted REST APIs / Integration Responses
To prevent exposing sensitive data from tables the user shouldnâ€™t access.

4.Flow Designer / Scripted Actions
When flows execute under a user session and data visibility must be respected.

5.Portal or Service Catalog scripts
Where front-end users query records indirectly through server scripts.

When NOT to Use GlideRecordSecure
Avoid it when:
1.Youâ€™re running system-level scripts (like Business Rules or Background Scripts) that must override ACLs for data migration, maintenance, or automation.
2.You are certain that the script runs as admin or system user and ACL enforcement isnâ€™t needed.

Always Remember :
ðŸ§­ If your script runs in a user context (UI, Portal, Flow, API) â€” use GlideRecordSecure.
ðŸ§° If your script runs in a system context (Business Rule, Fix Script, background process) â€” use GlideRecord.
